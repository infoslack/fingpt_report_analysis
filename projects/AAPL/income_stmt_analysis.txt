In the current fiscal year, Apple Inc. reported a slight decrease in total net sales to $383.3 billion, a 3% decline from the previous year, primarily due to weaker foreign currencies and lower sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by increased Services revenue. The cost of goods sold was substantial, leading to a gross profit of $169.1 billion. Operating expenses, including R&D and SG&A, totaled $54.8 billion, indicating a commitment to innovation and market expansion. The net income stood at $97.0 billion, showcasing robust profitability. The gross profit margin slightly improved, reflecting cost efficiency, while the operating and net profit margins underscored operational effectiveness and overall profitability. Despite the revenue dip, Apple's strategic focus on high-margin services and continuous innovation positions it well for sustainable revenue growth and potential areas for cost optimization and profit maximization.

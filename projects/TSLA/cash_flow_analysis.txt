The company's cash flow analysis for the latest fiscal year reveals a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, indicating a potential challenge in core business profitability. The increase in capital expenditures and investments in investing activities underscores a continued focus on expansion and growth. Financing activities shifted from net cash used to net cash provided, mainly due to increased debt issuance and decreased repayments, suggesting a reliance on external financing. Compared to prior periods, these trends highlight a strategic investment in growth despite operational cash flow pressures. The company's effective cash management and strategic financing decisions have maintained a solid liquidity position, supporting future growth. However, the reliance on debt financing and the operational cash flow decrease pose potential liquidity risks and financial challenges ahead.
